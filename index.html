	<h1> ◄ Nerve wrecking experience ever in my life ► </h1>
    <p1> I remember the first day of official tournament with other team players on FISC Championship 2018. The nerve wrecking when our team was almost lose the match. </p1>
    <br> </br>

    <p2> I used to involve myself in E-Sport gaming in 2018 and I remember vividly the event of FISC Championship 2018 where the strongest teams assemble. It was my first time involving such event in my entire life. The event was sponsored by Pinoyparisan Onmyoji and the winners will take the prize of RM5,000 and official merchandise and skins of Onmyoji Arena x Kumamon crossover. Onmyoji Arena is a moba game based on the RPG game called Onmyoji. The rules of the game are similar with other moba games except it is more into balanced heroes and gameplay without any additional stats. </p2>
    <br> </br>

    <p3> When I first heard the announcement of the tournament on Facebook page, I thought it was kind of fun if I ever get the chance to play the real tournament besides casual or ranking match. I've seen many pro players in the guild and I always thought I will never be one of them. </p3>
    <br> </br>

    <p4> One day, I'm usually playing rank or casual match when I have free time. There's one time that I got performed well in a match and got MVP title. "Pop!" The sound of my Messenger notifications popped up the screen. It turns out the leader of Sushi Guild personally messaged me. I was nervous because personally I'm not close enough with the leader, mostly we just reacted each other's posts on Facebook group. Basically, he was interested on how well I am in a previous match before. He asked me to play match with him sometime and I said yes. </p4>
    <br> </br>

    <p5> Since then, we spent a lot time matchmaking together in casual/rank match with other teammates. I remember I was having my usual breakfast in the morning while surfing Facebook posts and "Pop!", Facebook notifications popped up on my screen. Without hesitation, I clicked it and see who's been message me. It turns out it was the leader and asking me if I ever interested entering the tournament because they required one more player in a team for the role of support. I almost spitted my Milo drink and looking at the message with disbelief. I even asked many times to the leader am I really fit the role and the team. He said he believed in me and he's seen my previous match as support and mostly of the guild members are more into ninja/samurai roles. And I said yes without thinking twice.</p5>
    <br> </br>

    <p6> As the day passed by, the tournament day has come. The leader gave us the list of which team we would fight first. That moment I knew, I'm gonna have a match with pro players from different countries. This is not the same casual or rank match that I used to play. This is real. </p6>
    <br> </br>

    <p7> Short form of the story, we won the match against Waikiki Guild with 31/25 in semi finals. The final team we're going to face was YS Guild. I remember I used to play one of the YS Guild player and he's a pro jungler role. As usual before the match, we're in voice calling to communicate the strategies to win the match against the enemy team. I may be as a support role but it's a crucial role to keep the team alive and protect from the enemy team. </p7>
    <br> </br>

    <p8> As 20 minutes has passed, the enemy team had already dominated 6 of 9 towers in our team. It was an intense match. I could feel my teammates were feeling nervous and agitated at the same time when we're voice calling. We literally have 50/50 chances to win. It was crucial time. </p8>
    <br> </br>

    <p9> But somehow, in that day, our luck was in our side. We managed to seize the opportunity when the enemy team made a little mistake when we had an open war. I remember I was supporting my teammates from behind and trying to keep my teammates alive as much as possible. And yes, we managed to ace the enemy team. We heard our leader shouting in voice calling, "Push towers!" In that moment, our determination to win just burned up inside. Without hesitation, we managed to push all towers and attack the base. Guess what? We won! </p9>
    <br> </br>

    <p10> I just can't believe our team actually won the match. On the voice calling, we sounded pretty excited and joy. We congratulated to each other saying "Well played!". The next day, the results were coming out and I saw my guild name was in the list as the winner of FISC Championship 2018. The announcer of the game told us the rewards will be given to the leader of the team. </p10>
    <br> </br>

    <p11> At this moment I knew, finally, I have achieved something in my life. It may looked like it's just a game but for me, it's a new experience and joy in my life. I am proud of myself for finally getting something in return for doing something that you love. Plus, I have learned something from it. The ability to work together in a group, being able to develop problem-solving especially when we almost lose the match and lastly, communication is the key to success. Other than my past events that happened to me, I always cherish this one more. I hope I'll be able to join the tournament again in the future. </p11>
